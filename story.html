                        Iâ€™m a <b>Computer Engineering</b> student at the University of Lagos. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="animate-on-scroll">
                         When I was eleven, I approached <a target="_blank" href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/mayomi1" class="underline">someone</a> to teach me a tech skill, and I was introduced to search engine optimization. 
                        Although I couldn't continue then due to a lack of resources, my passion never waned.
                    </p>
                    <p class="animate-on-scroll">
                        A few months later, I asked him to teach me to code and he gave me access to his Sololearn account. 
                        That was where my programming journey truly began. 
                        I started with <b>Python</b> and grasped some basic programming fundamentals. 
                        I explored various tech courses in development, design, data science, and machine learning.
                        And finally decided to be a frontend guy.

                    <p class="animate-on-scroll">
                        At fourteen, I met <a target="_blank" href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/oladapo-j-adeleke" class="underline">another preson</a>, who generously gave me a laptop,
                        I can't thank him enough and I'm grateful to God for making us cross paths. <br>
                        With newfound resources, 
                        I immersed myself in mastering <b>Javascript</b> and many popular <b>CSS frameworks</b>, building projects alongside.
                    </p>
                    <p class="animate-on-scroll">I am an ardent <b>Christian</b> and most of the people who helped me are folks from my local church.</p>
                    <p class="animate-on-scroll">Now, I'm seeking a role where I can leverage my skills as frontend developer to help a company achieve its goals and be properly <b>mentored</b> in my career.</p>
                    <p class="mb-0 animate-on-scroll">I'm also experienced with <b>Linux</b></p>
